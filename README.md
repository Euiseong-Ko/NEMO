# NEMO
This repository includes an implementation of the NEMO (NEighborhood based Multi-Omics clustering) multi-omics clustering algorithm.
The implementation of the method is in NEMO.R. The other files include code to reproduce all NEMO results in the paper. 

NEMO requires prior installation of the R library SNFtool, and also uses some of its code:
